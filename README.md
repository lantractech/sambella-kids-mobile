## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Books tab

This app includes a simple "Books" tab that fetches and displays a grid of book covers from the Open Library public API. Pull down to refresh the grid. The screen lives at `app/(tabs)/books.tsx` and is added to the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.

Notes:

- Covers are loaded from `https://covers.openlibrary.org` using IDs returned by a basic search query (`children`).
- If a cover isn't available for a result, the item shows a neutral placeholder background.
